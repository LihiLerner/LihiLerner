🙋‍♀️ About Me  
### **I’m a Computer Science B.Sc. student at Bar-Ilan University, with a strong passion for software development and problem solving.**

Throughout my studies and projects, I’ve gained experience across a wide range of topics —  
from algorithms, data structures, and mathematics to object-oriented programming, networking, and full-stack development.

I’m highly self-motivated, detail-oriented, and enjoy working on complex systems that combine backend logic, APIs, and real-world use cases.
